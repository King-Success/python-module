## Introduction
A collection of personally developed python modules containing functions that implements multiple algorithm for searching and sorting alike. These algorithms has an O ranging from NlogN to N squared.

##Time complexity
As stated above, these algorithms has a time complexity ranging from NlogN to N squared. In most cases an omega of NlogN is experienced and an O of Nsquared

##Requirement
Python version 2.7 and above is a prerequisite.
Knowledge of command shell.
a text editor.
